Code Smells:

    Make reusable gui class (inheritance, overide methods)
        + make local & remote-specific button classes
        + buttonpanel.add()
            Adds created button varibles in method (made above)
            Move to seperate method
                for loop of .add() on list of button objects?
        + JPanel code is same in both classes
            Move to reusable gui class
            Move to seperate method
        + MouseListener is identical in both classes
            Move to reusable gui class
            Move to seperate method
            - Checks against null objects?
                Fix that somehow???
        + MouseClicked is very similar
            Pass option to reusable gui if local or remote
            Move to seperate method
        + JScrollPane
            seperate method
            

    RemoteDir.java
        gui_init()
            - HUGE METHOD
                Way too long
                Break into smaller methods? seperate into variable/object creation methods?
                Mouse* methods seperate from gui_init method? 
                    seperate class, pass in params
                
            - Long call names:
               Line 393 & 403 & 404 "jsp.getHorizontalScrollBar().addAdjustmentListener(adjustmentListener);"
                          
    LocalDir.java
        gui_init()
            - HUGE METHOD
            - buttonPanel
                Line 240 - 261
                Seperate class
                reuse for other gui_init() method?
            - buttons
                seperate class
                Can reuse for both gui_init() methods
